1. In this problem statement, we will find the average fare of each class.

gen_class_fare = foreach  load_data generate $2 ,$9;  

group_byclass = group gen_class_fare by $0;

avg_fare = foreach group_byclass generate group,AVG(gen_class_fare.$1);

dump avg_fare; 

2. In this problem statement, we will find the number of people alive in each class and embarked at Southampton.

gen_alive = foreach load_data generate $0,$1,$2,$11;

filter_alive_embark = filter gen_alive by $1 == '0' and $3 matches 'S';

group_into_class = group filter_alive_embark by $2;

count_people =  foreach group_into_class  generate group, COUNT(filter_alive_embark.$0);

dump count_people;

3. In this problem statement, we will find out number of males and females who died in each class.


gen_data = foreach load_data generate $0,$1,$2,$4;

filter_dead = filter gen_data by $1 == '1';

SPLIT filter_dead INTO filter_male  if $3 matches 'male',
filter_female if $3 matches 'female';

group_by_class_male = group filter_male by $2 ;

group_by_class_female = group filter_female by $2 ;

count_male = foreach  group_by_class_male generate group,COUNT(filter_male.$0);

count_female = foreach  group_by_class_female generate group,COUNT(filter_female.$0);

dump count_male;
dump count_female;
